# 📱 Smartphone Dataset Analysis

This repository contains a **complete Data Analysis project** on a smartphone dataset.  
The project was developed in **Google Colab** and focuses on **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and insights generation**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
The dataset consists of smartphones with details such as:
- Brand & Model
- Price
- RAM & Storage
- Battery Capacity
- Camera Specifications
- Display Details
- Android Version

The goal of this project is to:
1. Explore the dataset thoroughly.
2. Clean and prepare the data for analysis.
3. Perform **EDA** to uncover patterns and trends.
4. Derive meaningful insights for decision-making.

## 🗂️ Project Structure
1. **Data Loading & Inspection**
   - Check dataset shape, columns, missing values, and duplicates.
   - Inspect sample rows to understand raw formatting.

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Extract and clean numerical values from messy strings.
   - Convert price to numeric values.
   - Parse RAM, storage, battery capacity, and main camera MP.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Price distribution and summary statistics.
   - Brand-wise smartphone counts.
   - Median price by brand.
   - Feature correlations with price (RAM, storage, battery, camera).

4. **Insights & Observations**
   - Apple has the highest median smartphone price.
   - Budget brands like Nokia and Tecno dominate lower price ranges.
   - Camera megapixels show the strongest (but still weak) correlation with price.
   - RAM and battery capacity have little effect on price variation.
